# aprico-gen
Deterministic password generator based on `scrypt` algorithm.

This javascript library generates passwords that:
- are derived deterministically purely on user inputs (a master password, a service, an ID and other options);
- are generated 100% client-side in the browser;
- do not need to store data or keep any state.

For the full implementation see [aprico.org](https://aprico.org).

Uses the [scrypt-async-js](https://github.com/dchest/scrypt-async-js) library for the `scrypt` implementation.

How it works
------------

User inputs are concatenated and hashed through the `scrypt` algorithm with a cost of `N = 2^14`. The resulting hash is then splitted, re-iterated with a lighter cost (`N = 2^5`) while arbitrary converted to a custom alphabet made of letters, numbers and/or symbols.

The result is checked for some conditions (at least a character for each alphabet, no character repeated more than 2 times) and eventually re-hashed until those conditions are met.

Install
-------

`aprico-gen` is available on NPM:

    $ npm i aprico-gen

You can use it as a CommonJS module for both node.js and the browser (For node.js there are better built-in implementations but for this specific purpose `scrypt-async-js` should be good enough):

    const aprico = require('aprico-gen');

Or directly in your browser (but without dependencies, so you may want to include also the `scrypt-async-js` library):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/scrypt-async@2.0.1/scrypt-async.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/aprico-gen"></script>
```

API
---

Note: As you can see, this library is written in a synchronous fashion (also `scrypt-async-js`, despite its name, is used synchronously). The library is fast enough to avoid any browser freezing. More than that, with the used parameters, from my findings this sync implementation is actually faster than an async one.

#### `getPassword(password, service, hashId, options)`

Derives a unique password and a hash based on user inputs. You can use the hash as an entropy source to implement your own alphabet or to create other deterministic derivatives. `hashId` is actually used as a salt, you can use a hash pre-generated with `getHashId` (see later) or implement your own.

Some characters are missing from the alphabet (`l`, `I`, `O` and `0`). This is by design, to avoid ambiguity in generated passwords (like `1lI0O`) and make them less prone to misreading for users.

```javascript
// default options:
let options = {
	length : 20, // min 4, max 40
	letters : true, // use letters (abcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ)
	numbers : true, // use numbers (123456789)
	symbols	: true, // use symbols (_!$-+)
	variant : false // or STRING, to get a different password while preserving other inputs
}

let results = aprico.getPassword ('letmein', 'website.com', hashId, options);

console.log(results);
// {
//  	pass: 'vnscMKN_9z5a$cQC+J8G',
//  	hash: 'f9e5ce41fc655f8cdd2a103e0ed7b1db99a4618f517d6aa324e406268a650d96'
// }
```

#### `getHashId(id)`

Derives a hash from the user ID that can be used as a salt in `getPassword`. This can be saved on your end for later re-use.

```javascript
let hashId = aprico.getHashId('user@email.com');

console.log(hashId)
// "263f5a46fc0abcee64e59c086327b15cc07f0ec7b7fc16ee2ca5b791e6e63477"
```

#### `normalizeService(service)`

Returns a lowecased `service` and, if it is a URL, it is stripped down to hostname only to improve usability. Note: This function is exposed mainly as a way to reflect the normalized service in UIs as `getPassword` already calls this internally when generating a password.

```javascript
let service = aprico.normalizeService('https://www.website.com/login');

console.log(service); // 'www.website.com'
```

#### `version`

Returns the current version number.

```javascript
console.log( aprico.version ) // "1.0.0"
```
